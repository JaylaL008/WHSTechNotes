I dislike the new phone law. I dont mind not using my phone in class, but not being able to use it during lunch either or not being able to contact their parents or the parents to reach them is crazy. For example, theres no need to ban them during lunch because thats the only break we get during the school day. Kids need to be able to use them during lunch or the bathroom because its free time. The kids should also be able to contact their parents in case of emergency. For example, Dress code. If the child needs extra pants, they should be able to call them. School shootings. If we are locked in the classroom, we should be able to call our parents for help and to come pick them up. in conclusion, the we should be able to use our phones when we need to because its our devices our parents(or child) pays for. If someone in class doesnt want to pay attention, thats on them. They wont be able to graduate.

When I get older, I want to be an entreprenuer and create a baking business. Computer science could help keep track of the ingredients like when we run out. I could use it to create a program to track the inventory to predict when the supplies run low. In my life, I used computer science to create a program and website with the help of my mom so that people could order cookies. It was hard but extremely helpful.
