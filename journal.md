A game that I really enjoy is called Red Dead Redemption 2. It is a game based on the mid 1800's. It is very fun to play because you get to own a horse, do missions, own weapons, customize your character's appearence, etc. This game was made by the same company that created GTA5.

Following instructions exactly as given is cruical when learning how to code because programming languages are percise, and even small deviations can lead to errors or unintended outcomes. Coding relies on specific syntax and lofic, so missing a step can cause the code to fail or behave unexpectadly. Adhering to instructions also helps develop a solid foundation of best practices, ensuring that learners understand fundamental concepts before they start experimenting or customizing code. This precision fosters a mindset of attention to detail, which is essential for solving problems and debugging effectively.
 The precision of a measurement says nothing about whether the measurements are grouped about the correct value.
 The whole command will be wrong.
 So that you avoid making any mistakes.
