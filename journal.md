I dislike the new phone law. I dont mind not using my phone in class, but not being able to use it during lunch either or not being able to contact their parents or the parents to reach them is crazy. For example, theres no need to ban them during lunch because thats the only break we get during the school day. Kids need to be able to use them during lunch or the bathroom because its free time. The kids should also be able to contact their parents in case of emergency. For example, Dress code. If the child needs extra pants, they should be able to call them. School shootings. If we are locked in the classroom, we should be able to call our parents for help and to come pick them up. in conclusion, the we should be able to use our phones when we need to because its our devices our parents(or child) pays for. If someone in class doesnt want to pay attention, thats on them. They wont be able to graduate.

When I get older, I want to be an entreprenuer and create a baking business. Computer science could help keep track of the ingredients like when we run out. I could use it to create a program to track the inventory to predict when the supplies run low. In my life, I used computer science to create a program and website with the help of my mom so that people could order cookies. It was hard but extremely helpful.

My idea for an AI project would be an app that uses Ai to help students study like ChatGBT or IXL. The project would be able to function properly because it would use Ai correctly to support students or workers and their education. It can help students with their homework or classwork. It can help WOrkers wih ideas for a business project. I believe this idea would be helpful because it gives people chances to learn more at their own pace. Building confidence in their work and gaining more help for difficult subjects.

In my opinion, I think its great that IKEA created a job in roblox that pays you. Kids love to play games like Roblox, and some (including me) struggle to find jobs in real life. Creating a job in Roblox where the child can have fun and get paid at the same time would be easy money for them. One con to it would be that they probably wont have enough time to go outside. Even though I support the idea, I believe its better to have a job that has you walk around and move things physically so that youre working more muscles than your fingers.

The so-called 6,7 trend started with a song that says 67 in a basketball edit. It came up out of nowhere and people would say it at random like a vocal stim. It's kind of annoying. People would say it when they see or hear people say ," 6-7 business days." That or when someone asks the time and the other responds with," six minutes to seven."

If I was in change of the school, my technology policy would be that kids can use their phones in class and breaks, but if the teacher is in a lecture they must put it away. Kids can use AI on occasions, and they can play online games. For example, I dont know why our school banned Cool Math Games. Im not sure if they did it just because or if kids were using it too much, but it was never an issue or offensive. Kids should be able to use other games like Prodegy too.

My prompt is describing the American Revolution. Canva created an interactive timeline to learn more about the American Revolution. Although I do think It could be more colorful. The parts that worked the best was the Show less/more tab. To improve the prompt next time, I would make it more colorful and maybe with pictures this time.

The reason why it's a big deal is because millions of Americans use SNAP. If it was taken, a lot of families would struggle to get food. I feel like apps and websites would help show them different food banks would be using advertisements. If people didnt have phones or electronics, it would be harder for them to find food banks. Unless food banks would be posted on news paper ads. If I created a tool to help solve food insecurity, it would be called the food indicator. It would be a robot that goes to houses struggling to find food and give them ads and locations for local food banks.
