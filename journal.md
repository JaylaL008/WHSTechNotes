A game that I really enjoy is called Red Dead Redemption 2. It is a game based on the mid 1800's. It is very fun to play because you get to own a horse, do missions, own weapons, customize your character's appearence, etc. This game was made by the same company that created GTA5.

I did encounter a couple of challenges. I have bad memory so I have trouble remembering where to go when it comes to filling out the journals.
